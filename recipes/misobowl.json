  "instructions": "Begin grains early to have them ready when vegetables and sauce are done.  Roast the potatoes on a parchment lined baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and salt at 400F for 15-20 minutes being careful to allow them to brown without burning.  While the vegetables are roasting, combine the sesame oil, neutral oil, honey, garlic, ginger, rice vinegar, tahini and miso in a for processor or blender and combine until almost smooth with just a but of texture remaining.  Remove the potatoes and toss around to new sides then top with the broccoli florets and another drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt.  Cook for another 10-15 minutes; the potatoes should be cooked through and the broccoli tender and just browning on the edges.  Create a base of rice and add a pile of vegetables topped with a few spoonfuls of sauce and sesame seeds and sriracha to your liking."
