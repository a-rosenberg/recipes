  "instructions": "Heat a 12-14\" pan on medium heat. Add onions, peppers, a few tablespoons of olive oil and a small pinch of salt and cook until transluscent and just beginning to brown. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the cumin and smoked paprika and cook for 30 more. Dump in the tomatoes and crush with a wooden spoon until it resembles a chunky pasta sauce. Bring to a boil then reduce to low and simmer for approximately 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the sauce from burning at the bottom, until it is the consistency of oatmeal. This is a good time to taste the sauce and season it until it tastes right. Distribute the eggs evenly over the surface and spoon the sauce over some of the egg white before covering. Cook for 5-10 minutes checking for the eggs to be completely cooked like it is poached. Once the eggs are just about cooked, remove from heat and sprinkle with feta and parsley, a light drizzle of a good olive and a few cracks of pepper. Serve with pitas, naan, or a baguette."
