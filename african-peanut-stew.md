## Ingredients
- 1 bunch collard greens; washed and rinsed
- 1 onion; small dice
- 1 inch of ginger root; grated
- 4 garlic cloves; minced
- 6 cups broth
- 1 large or 2 small sweet potato; 1/2" dice
- 6 oz can tomato paste
- 1/2 cup natural peanut butter
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 large pinch of red pepper flakes
- 1/4 cup minced cilantro leaves (optional)
- 1/4 cup peanuts (optional)

## Instructions
1. Sauté the ginger and garlic in neutral oil over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until the garlic becomes soft and fragrant. 
2. Add onion the pot, and continue to sauté. Add sweet potato to the pot, and continue to sauté a few minutes more, or until the onion is soft and the sweet potato takes on a darker, slightly translucent appearance. Season with cumin and red pepper flakes. 
3. Add the tomato paste and peanut butter, and stir until everything is evenly mixed. Add the vegetable broth and stir to dissolve the thick tomato paste-peanut butter mixture. Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to high. 
4. While the soup is coming up to a boil, prepare the collard greens. Rinse the greens well, then use a sharp knife to remove each stem (cut along the side of each stem). Stack the leaves, then cut them into thin strips. Add the collard strips to the soup pot. 
5. Once the soup reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and allow it to simmer without a lid for about 15 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are very soft. Once soft, smash about half of the sweet potatoes with the back of a wooden spoon to help thicken the soup. 
6. Taste the soup and add salt if needed (will depend on the brand of broth used). Serve the stew hot with a few cilantro leaves if desired.

## Notes
I've used coconut or avocado oil. Broth is traditionally vegetable broth but can be any type.  I like to serve this with brown rice.
